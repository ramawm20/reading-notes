# why this topic matters ?!
+ It is the most important thing to learn and understand the C# it revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes also it provide guidelines and best practices for designing and implementing software systems using objects. So By grasping it, you'll be able to design more professional software systems in C# because it help you write code that is easier to understand, test, and refactor.
#
# Inheritance :
+ It is one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming which enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes we have 2 classes the **Base Class** which you inherit from and the **derived class** which inherits from the base.When you define a class to derive from another class, the derived class implicitly gains all the members of the base class, except for its **constructors and finalizers** 
#
# Abstract
+ a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency. Classes can be declared as abstract by putting the keyword abstract before the class it may also define abstract methods. This is accomplished by adding the keyword abstract before the return type of the method, Abstract methods have no implementation, so the method definition is followed by a semicolon instead of a normal method block. Derived classes of the abstract class must implement all abstract methods.
# Polymorphism:
+ polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of a common base type. It provides the ability to write code that can operate on objects without needing to know their specific implementations. Polymorphism enables the use of inheritance, interfaces, and method overriding, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in software design. By leveraging polymorphism, developers can create code that is more modular, reusable, and adaptable, leading to cleaner and more maintainable applications.

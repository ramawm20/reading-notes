# **The Command Line**
## 1.The Command Line:
+ Also known as a **Terminal** You can do on it several tasks in the same time. It is a text based interface which enables you to write commands that performs a specific orders first you will type the command then you will get your result not like the other commands some of the other don't show you the result.

+ Within a terminal you have what is known as a shelland the most common one is the **bash** so If you would like to know which shell you are using use an **echo** to display a system variable stating your current shell.

+ The most important thing to know that the terminal saves your commands and you can get them by the **Up arrow**.
# 
## 2.Basic Navigation:
+ It is the ability to navigate through directories (folders) and files using command-line instructions.
#### Here are some usefull commands to use at the terminal:
+ **pwd** => *(Print Working Directory)* It tells you what your current or present working directory is, use it to remember where exactly you are.
+ **ls** *(list)* List all what you have at the directory.You can write another optional items within **ls** to do specific orders.
There are another commands like **cd,mkdir,rm -rf and others.

#### Paths :
+ Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a path.   
There are 2 type of paths:   
**Relative path :**   
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.   
**Absolute path :**   
A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

# 
## 3.More About Files:
+ Everything is a file,  A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. You can use **File** to know the type of your file.

+ Dont forget that **Linux is Case Sensitive** 

+ **Spaces in names** :You can use spces in names but be carefull when you use because sometimes the terminal will misunderstand the name so to avoid this if you named your directory with space use the **quotes** or **\backslash** to go inside it. 

+ There are some hidden files which start with **dot .**.

#
## 4.Manual Pages:
+ The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do.invoke the manual pages with the following command:   
**man <-command to look up->** so Instead of trying to remember everything, instead remember you can easily look stuff up in the man pages..

#
## 5.File Manipulation :
####  To begin working with the terminal and to manipulate files you will need these commands :

+ To create directory use The command **mkdir** with the name of the directory  which is short for Make Directory. And to remove it use **rmdir** also with the name of the directory you want to remove.
+ To create any file type **touch** with the name of the file and it's extension **ex: touch index.html**.
+ To move a file we use the command **mv** with the file you want to move and where and the rename if you want.

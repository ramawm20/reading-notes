# Trees

## What is a tree?

A tree is a non-linear data structure that models a hierarchical organization. It consists of nodes (where the data is stored) that are connected via links. The tree data structure stems from a single node called the **root node** and has subtrees connected to the root.

A tree can be thought of as a family tree. The root node of the tree represents the family patriarch or matriarch, and the child nodes represent their children. The grandchildren of the root node would be the child nodes of the child nodes, and so on.

## Types of trees

There are many different types of trees, but some of the most common include:

* **Binary trees:** A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two child nodes.
* **N-ary trees:** An n-ary tree is a tree in which each node can have any number of child nodes, up to a maximum of n.
* **Complete trees:** A complete tree is a tree in which all of the levels below the root are completely filled, except for the last level, which may be partially filled.
* **Balanced trees:** A balanced tree is a tree in which the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1.

## Applications of trees

Trees are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

* **File systems:** File systems are often implemented using trees. The root node of the tree represents the root directory, and the child nodes represent the subdirectories.
* **Databases:** Trees are often used to store and organize data in databases. For example, a tree can be used to store the relationships between different tables in a database.
* **Compilers:** Trees are often used in compilers to represent the syntax of a programming language. For example, a tree can be used to represent the parse tree of a program.

## Implementation of trees

There are many different ways to implement trees in code. One common way is to use a linked list data structure to represent the nodes in the tree. Each node in the linked list would contain a pointer to its parent node, as well as pointers to its left and right child nodes.

Another way to implement trees is to use an array data structure. In this case, the array would be used to store the nodes in the tree, and the indexes of the array would be used to represent the relationships between the nodes.

## Quiz

    * The root node
2. What are the two types of child nodes in a tree?
    * **Left child nodes** and **right child nodes**
3. What is the name of the data structure that is commonly used to implement trees?

## Vocabulary

* **Tree:** A non-linear data structure that models a hierarchical organization.
* **Node:** A data structure that stores data and references to other nodes.
* **Root node:** The top node in a tree.
* **Child node:** A node that is directly connected to another node.
* **Parent node:** A node that is directly connected to another node.
* **Linked list:** A data structure that stores data in a linked list.
* **Array:** A data structure that stores data in an array.

## Cheat sheet

# Collections & Enums
## Why this topic Matters?!
+ It's provide the developers with powerful tools for managing and manipulating data in their programs. Both enhances the flexibility and organization of code, leading to more efficient and maintainable software.

#
## Collections: 
+ Collections provide a more flexible way to work with groups of objects. Unlike arrays, the group of objects you work with can grow and shrink dynamically as the needs of the application change. A collection **is a class**, so you must declare an instance of the class before you can add elements to that collection.
+ Using a Simple Collection You can make a **List <T.> class**, which enables you to work with a strongly typed list of objects.

#
## Enumeration types(Enums):
+ An enumeration type (or enum type) is a value type defined by a set of named constants of the underlying integral numeric type.
+ Enums are declared using **the enum keyword**, followed by a name and a set of comma-separated constant values enclosed in curly braces.
+ You cannot define a method inside the definition of an enumeration type.
+ The System.Enum type is the abstract base class of all enumeration types. It provides a number of methods to get information about an enumeration type and its values.

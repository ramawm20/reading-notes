# Authentication, authorization, and cookies

## Why This topic Matters =>


 + First, they are vital for ensuring the security of web applications by verifying user identities and controlling access to resources. Second, they enhance the user experience by maintaining session state and personalizing interactions through cookies. Third, they enable compliance with privacy and data protection regulations, which is critical in today's legal landscape. Fourth, these concepts help manage state and user interactions in scalable web applications, ensuring smooth performance. Finally, C# offers libraries and frameworks that simplify the implementation of robust authentication and authorization solutions, making them essential for developing secure and user-friendly web applications.

## HTTP cookies =>

+ An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:          
     Session management          
      Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember.

     User preferences, themes, and other settings.

     Recording and analyzing user behavior.

## Origin of cookies
One of the biggest issues in the early days of the web was how to manage state. In short, the server had no way of knowing if two requests came from the same browser. The easiest approach, at the time, was to insert some token into the page when it was requested and get that token passed back with the next request. This required either using a form with a hidden field containing the token or to pass the token as part of the URL’s query string. Both solutions were intensely manual operations and prone to errors.

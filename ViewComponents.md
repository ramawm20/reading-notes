# Intro to View Components
+ A View Component in ASP.NET Core is a versatile feature designed to render specific chunks of reusable UI logic within web applications. It shares similarities with controllers and views, offering separation of concerns and testability benefits. View Components can accept parameters and incorporate business logic, making them suitable for rendering complex UI elements like dynamic navigation menus, tag clouds, sign-in panels, shopping carts, and more. They are typically invoked from layout pages and consist of a class (usually derived from ViewComponent) that defines the logic and a view responsible for rendering the output. While View Components are well-suited for server-side rendering, developers should also consider Razor components for client-side UI logic and composition, especially when building modern web applications. Razor components offer a similar combination of markup and C# code for creating reusable UI units.

# Create view Component :
+ Create a View Component Class: Start by creating a C# class that derives from the ViewComponent class. This class will contain the logic for your View Component.

+ Create a Razor View: You'll also need to create a Razor view (.cshtml file) associated with your View Component. This view will define the HTML markup and layout of your component.

+ Invoke the View Component: In your Razor views or layouts, you can invoke your custom View Component using the @await Component.InvokeAsync("ComponentName") syntax.

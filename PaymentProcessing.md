# How credit cards proccessing works 
+ Credit card processing is a multistep system that enables merchants to accept credit card payments. When a customer makes a purchase, the merchant sends the payment details to a payment processor or gateway, which forwards the request to the customer's issuing bank. The bank verifies the transaction's legitimacy and credit availability, responding with either an authorization code or decline message. If approved, the merchant captures the transaction and initiates settlement, transferring funds from the issuing bank to their account, minus processing fees. This process ensures secure and efficient payment handling.
+ How it works ?        
     +  Customer Payment: The customer provides their credit card information during a purchase.

     + Merchant Request: The merchant sends this information to a payment processor or gateway.

     + Authorization: The payment processor contacts the customer's bank to verify the transaction.

     + Bank Response: The bank responds with an approval or decline.

     + Merchant Action: If approved, the merchant completes the sale; if declined, they inform the customer.

     + Capture and Settlement: The merchant captures the transaction and, later, funds are transferred from the bank to the merchant's account.

     + Fees Deducted: Payment processor fees are deducted from the funds transferred.

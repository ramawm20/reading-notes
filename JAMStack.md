# JAM Stack
+ JAMstack is a software architecture and philosophy that adheres to the following components: Javascript, APIs, and Markup it is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum productivity The core principles of pre-rendering, and decoupling, enable sites and applications to be delivered with greater confidence and resilience than ever before.
+ Pre-rendering => With Jamstack, the entire front end is prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets during a build process. This process of pre-rendering results in sites which can be served directly from a CDN, reducing the cost, complexity and risk, of dynamic servers as critical infrastructure.

## What makes up the JAMstack?
+ It's typically comprised of 3 components: Javascript, APIs, and Markup.

### Javascript
+ The component that’s probably done the most work to popularize the JAMstack is Javascript. Our favorite browser language allows us to provide all of the dynamic and interactive bits that we might not have if we’re serving plain HTML without it.

### APIs
+ Utilizing the strengths of APIs is core to how you make a JAMstack app dynamic. Whether it’s authentication or search, your application will use Javascript to make an HTTP request to another provider which will ultimately enhance the experience in one form or another.

### Markup
+ This is the critical piece. Whether it’s your hand written HTML or the code that compiles down to the HTML, it's the first part you’re serving to the client. This is kind of a de facto piece of any website, but how you serve it is the most important piece.

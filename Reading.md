# Readings: Exception Handling

### -Why this topic matters as it relates to what I am studying in this module?

+ This topic gives basics of the most important steps to begin coding with C# language, First it talks about the debugging, how to figure out the errors while you are debugging and how to exactly fix this bugs and errors. Second it gives us summary about the try/Catch which allow you to try your code and throw an exception when something goes wrong. Finally it advice how to handle the exceptions that appears from try/catch. So it's very useful. 

# 
### -Name one major benefit of being able to trace the call stack?
 + It's agood way to examine and understand the execution flow of an app to figure out specific errors.

# 
 ### -If you could use try/catch in your day to day life, name an exception you’d like to ‘catch’ and handle?
 + If I can use the try / catch in my daily life, then I can use it by cooking to try a specific dish and throw an exception if there is something wrong in it to find out the mistake and correct it, and this prevents me from throwing the whole dish.

 #
 ### -From an efficiency standpoint, are there downsides to try/catch blocks?
 + I don't think so.

 #
 ### -Describe how you explain the .Net approach to exception handling to a non technical friend.
 + Exception handling in .NET is like having a plan for dealing with these unexpected issues. When an error or problem occurs, the program can "throw" an exception, which is like a signal that something went wrong. Just like how you might have a backup plan or a way to handle mistakes while baking a cake, in programming, we also need to handle these exceptions.
